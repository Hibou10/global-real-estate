# ðŸŒ† Global Urbanization 

Urbanization refers to the increasing concentration of populations in cities and urban areas.  
It is one of the most powerful forces shaping housing demand, infrastructure, and the real estate market.  
As more people move to cities, property prices, rent levels, and construction activity often rise â€” sometimes faster than income growth.  

This dashboard explores the **relationship between urbanization, construction, and housing affordability** across countries and years.  
It helps reveal how quickly cities are expanding and how this impacts the real estate sector.
